# GraphQL and TypeScript Workshop

This repository contains the exercises for my [Type-safe GraphQL apps with TypeScript](https://www.aaron-powell.com/talks/type-safe-graphql-apps-with-typescript-workshop/) workshop.

## Undertaking the workshop

The workshop is designed to be instructor-led, so if you would like to participate in it contact me via the [info on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/aaronpowell). But it can be a self-directed workshop, with the guides being within the [`instructions`](instructions) folder.

## Prerequisites

### VS Code Devcontainers

The workshop contains [VS Code Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers?WT.mc_id=javascript-13112-aapowell) to help setup your environment. You can either open the whole repository in one, each step of the workshop or the completed application.

If you have access to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) you can alternatively use that with the provided Devcontainer

### Required Software

If you are unable to use the Devcontainer the following software is required:

- [Node.js 12](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/)
- A text editor
- [Azure Function Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=javascript-13112-aapowell#v2)

## Optional steps

The workshop is designed to be run without any database or hosting platform, but if you desire it can be configured to use [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/serverless?WT.mc_id=javascript-13112-aapowell) and deployed to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-13112-aapowell). If you don't have an Azure account, you can sign up for one [for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-13112-aapowell).
